                    <h1>What is Axie Infinity?</h1>
                    Created in 2018 by Vietnamese developer Sky Mavis, Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-style, turn-based NFT
                    game that pits cute little creatures called Axies against each other. Available on Android and PC,
                    the game’s objective is to build up a team of three Axies and use them in a battle against either
                    computer-controlled enemies (PvE) or other real-life players (PvP).
                    You collect Smooth Love Potions (SLPs) in the game, which double as cryptos and can be bought and
                    sold on exchanges. You can earn SLPs by completing PvE and PvP challenges.
                    Additionally, there are Axie Infinity Shards (AXS), which is the governance token for the whole Axie
                    Infinity Universe—the current game and all its future games. To breed new Axies for future
                    deployment, you’ll need both AXS and SLPs.
                    The game also has a built-in Energy system, which you’ll need if you want to earn SLPs in the Arena
                    mode. This means that once you run out of Energy, you’ll have fewer ways of farming SLPs. However,
                    the more Axies you have, the more Energy you’ll have to work with and the faster it’ll be
                    replenished.

                    <br><br><b>3-9 Axies</b>: 20 Energy; regain 5 Energy every 6 hours
                    <br><b>10-19 Axies</b>: 40 Energy; regain 5 Energy every 3 hours
                    <br><b>20+ Axies</b>: 60 Energy; regain 5 Energy every 2 hours
                    <br><br>Since each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT), it can be bought and sold on the Axie
                    Marketplace. Just to give you an idea of how much you can make from selling an Axie: the most
                    expensive sale so far happened in late 2020 and a triple-mystic Axie called Angel sold for 300
                    ETH—which, at the time, was worth around 120,000 USD.

                    <h1>How to earn money in Axie Infinity</h1>

                    To be able to earn in this game, you’ll need to earn SLPs. To earn them, you can do the following:
                    <br><br><b>Complete your Daily Quest </b> – Do your daily check-in, complete 10 Adventure mode levels, and win 5 Arena matches to earn 25 SLP. 
                    <br><b>Adventures (PvE) </b>– Earn a maximum of 50 SLP every day by doing PvE missions called Ruins. 
                    <br><b>Arena (PvP) </b> – To participate in Arena battles, you’ll need to use your Energy. The amount of SLP you can win will depend on your rating. You start earning when your rating goes higher than 800 (1 SLP per win) and is capped at 20 SLP per win (1,750+ rating).
                
                    <br><br>To cash out your earnings, there are two methods you can use:

                    <br><br><b>Exchange your SLP tokens </b>– Trade your SLP tokens in for crypto and cash them out in any way you like. Here’s how to do this on Paxful:
                    <br>- First, convert your SLP into BTC/USDT/ETH. You can do this by going to the buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tether page then select Ronin: SLP as your payment method
                    <br>- As soon as it’s converted to the crypto of your choice, go to the sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tether page and sell your crypto for cash using an e-wallet, debit or credit card, bank transfer, gift card, or from the hundreds of other payment options available on Paxful.
                    <br><b>Breed new Axies </b>– Give your AXS and SLP back to the platform and breed new Axies to sell. Here’s how to cash out your earnings on Paxful:
                    <br>- When you sell Axies on the marketplace, you’re paid in Wrapped ETH (WETH).
                    <br>- Convert it back into ETH by sending the WETH to your MetaMask using the Ronin Bridge.
                    <br>- Send the ETH to your Paxful Wallet.
                    <br>- Sell the ETH on Paxful and get paid using our roster of nearly 400 payment options. 
                    <br><b>Rank among the best </b>– Earn AXS by ranking among the top 1,000 players in the world.
